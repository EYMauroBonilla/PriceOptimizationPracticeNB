# Priceloop Nocode + ML Price Optimization Example

This is an example on how you can build a simple ML Price Optimization model and connect to our Nocode platform to get the data and then also export it back so that you can post-process your output. The ML part is heavily based on this [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pratx557/price-elasticity/notebook) and we adopted it for our use case.

### Getting Started

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
